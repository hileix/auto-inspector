# Open-Source Web Testing AI Agent

Auto Inspector is <b>fully open-sourced (Apache 2.0)</b> and <a href="https://magicinspector.com">Magic Inspector</a> offers cloud hosting and dedicated enterprise grade support.


## Demo 

User story: I can log in to my account with 'demo@magicinspector.com' and 'demopassword' and create a new test inside the Default Project. Once the test has been created, I can see the test editor.
